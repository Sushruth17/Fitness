  "description": "Photo by @shonephoto Robbie Shone | Exploration of Ora river cave finished after just 600 metres (2000 ft). With so many river crossings to undertake, the going was fairly slow (but extremely exciting). The river of white water rapids rarely got below 8 to 10 cubic metres per second. After about six days we reached the sump (where the water reaches the roof), and so our ‘dry’ exploration was finished. We retreated to the surface for other projects. Here you see daylight streaming in at the Ora cave entrance. After a hard trip, something this beautiful is a welcome sight. You can even smell the moist wet vegetation outside the cave, long before you see it."
